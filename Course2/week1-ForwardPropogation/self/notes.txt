    Training Data: Imagine you have a big stack of flashcards, each with a question on one side and the answer on the other. 
    This stack represents your training data.

    Epoch: Going through the entire stack of flashcards once is like completing one epoch. 
    So, if you go through the entire stack of flashcards three times, you've completed three epochs.

    Batch: Instead of looking at all the flashcards at once, you might find it easier to study in smaller groups. 
    Each of these smaller groups is a batch. For example, if you have 100 flashcards and you study them in groups of 10, you have 10 batches.

    Iteration: Going through one batch is like completing one iteration. 
    So, if you have 10 batches and you go through each one once, you've completed 10 iterations, which is one epoch.

In summary, an epoch is like completing a full pass through all your study material (training data), 
and the number of epochs tells you how many times you want to go through that material. 
Batches are just smaller groups you use to make the learning process more manageable, 
and iterations are the number of times you go through one of these smaller groups.
